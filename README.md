## ü§ñ Recommendation System

### How It Works
The recommendation system uses a **content-based filtering** approach:

1. **User Likes**: Users can like products they're interested in
2. **Image Similarity**: Each product has precomputed image embeddings
3. **Recommendation Generation**: When a user likes products, the system finds similar products based on:
   - Image similarity using precomputed embeddings
   - Product categories and attributes
4. **Display**: Recommended products appear on product detail pages

### User Interactions
- **Like Products**: Users can like products to indicate preferences
- **View Recommendations**: Similar products are suggested based on likes
- **Browse by Category**: Products organized by categories
